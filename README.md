### Project Description
---------------------

I'd like to make a one page website that the user doesn't have to move from.  The full version will have buttons with panels that pop out with all of the different ellements of the webpage [(Steel-CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com/219/)).  The mobile version will need to be even more simply designed.  It will either have a dropdown menu with the options that open in the current page, or it may need to have the user scroll to the different headings.  I will need to work with this to find out which will work for the project.  I would like a simple and somewhat cartoony design with few colors in both versions ([Matt Farley Portfolio](https://mattfarley.ca/)).  It will be mostly greyscale with one color for accent.  I would also like to look into using multiple background images to give a layered depth ([Steel-CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com/219/)).
